ahhh... nothing like chilling with yr homie after a long day of grueling field work, enjoying a nice brewski on the deck. just guys being dudes, yknow? it really makes it all worth it. the civilization thing yknow? like i wasn't all *that* into it at first but eventually i came around on it. mostly, yknow? like sometimes the forced farm labor kinda sucks but also damn look at all this bread we get to eat! and delicious foggy beer! honestly not too bad a trade from the whole huntin' and gatherin' thing yknow?
